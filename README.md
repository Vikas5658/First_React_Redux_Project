# First_React_Redux_Project_with_Firebase

This is my first project on Github, which is simple MailDashboard.

In this project I have used Redux for very first time for login and registration and also for compose mail popup.

I have used firebase for authentication and storing data.

This project includes Login, Register and Dashboard.

In the dashboard I have created following components..
# Header
# Sidebar
        - Sidebar includes compose button and sidebar options which has Inbox, Sent mail like options with icons.
# Send mail popup
         - Send mail popup will open after clicking on the compose button, here I have used Redux for state management.
# Mail main body
          -Mail main body inludes mail rows, which include mails when we send mail.
# Firebase
          -I ahve used firebase for authentication and storing data.
